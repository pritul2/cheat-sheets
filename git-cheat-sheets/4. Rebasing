## Rebasing
* It is alternative and powerful technique than git merge. 
* Merge is preferred mainly over rebase
* Here whatever are the commit history will be appended to the merging branch

`git rebase <branch_to_merge_>`

## Stashing
* Sometimes instead of all commits history, we need only particular one, in that case we use stashing

`git rebase --interactive`   
Change "pick" to "s"

* Add commit message and it is done.
